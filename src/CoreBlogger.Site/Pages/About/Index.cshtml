    <h1>Hi I'm Bryan!</h1>
    <h2>My Bio</h2>
    <p>
        Hi!  My name is Bryan McCoy.  I'm an Application Architect for a large insurance company.  I have a degree in Computer Science
       from Southeastern Louisiana University.  I am passionate about software development in all shapes and sizes.  My prefered stack
       is .Net, but I am open to trying anything.  The right tool for the right job!  I am also a active member in my .Net community.
       and part of the Baton Rouge .Net User leadership.  You should stop in and say hello!
    </p>
    <h2>My Skills</h2>
    <p>
        By day I work in the Microsoft stack.  I use everything from a Windows dev machine, VsCode, Visual Studios, Microsoft Sql Server, IIS, Windows Server, C#, .Net Core, etc...
       I also have a lot of experience in Angular starting with version 1.3 up to and including Angular 7.  I have also been known to do a little KnockoutJs.
    </p>
    <p>
        By night I am all over the place.  My personal projects are done with Docker, Ubuntu, Nginx, .Net Core, Reactjs, Angular, python, MySql, and much more.
        I love exploring new frameworks and libraries. 
    </p>
    <h2>For Fun</h2>
        <p>
            I spend my free time hacking away at various projects.  Most of which can be found on my github repository.  I also frequent local User Groups, and am an active board member for the Baton Rouge <a href="https://www.brdnug.org/" target="_blank">.Net User Group</a>.
        </p>
